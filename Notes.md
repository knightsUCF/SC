Abstract (might be later in the process)




<h3> Summary of abstract </h3>

One way to investigate cellular responses to injury is through transcriptomic profiling of cell types that comprise the injury site.

In this study, we used sc-RNAseq to generate a single cell transcriptomics dataset of virtually all cell types that comprise the uninjured and injured spinal cord at 1, 3, and 7dpi. From this dataset, we were able to obtain unique molecular signatures of multiple cell types as well as their subpopulations present throughout the acute injury phase. By assessing expression of ligandreceptor pairs on different cell types, we were able to gain insight into potential signaling relationships that mediat angiogenesis, gliosis, and fibrosis. As the first sc-RNAseq analysis of the spinal cord injury site, our transcriptomic dataset will provide the field with novel and comprehensive insight into early spinal cord injury pathology as well as other traumatic injuries to the CNS.
