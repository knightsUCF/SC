# Plan

- while waiting for the dependency issue to be resolved, continue

- we have to continue on the Mac, so check one more time if somehow we can resolve this, if not we just have to keep moving, while not getting our feet stuck in time sinks, just yet

- after we exhaust the other steps we can determine what is left in terms of fixing dependencies

- upgrading to latest Ubuntu, not enough space: https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-upgrade-from-ubuntu-linux-16-04-to-18-04/

- entering these two things into the R console, will show where the error is coming from:

options(error=recover) 

options(show.error.locations=TRUE)




# Set Working Directory
